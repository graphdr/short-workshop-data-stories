The iterative process we developed to “find the story” in our data has been instrumental in shaping my approach to data graphics. You can read more about our research at https://midfield.online/.\r\nI occasionally write about visual rhetoric, graph design, and R on my Data Stories blog.\r\n\r\nMusic\r\nMy dad was a guitar player and taught me my first chords. I’ve been songwriting, performing, and composing since my teens. I’ve posted some draft tracks to SoundCloud.\r\nA favorite musical pilgrimage is the annual Swannanoa Gathering near Asheville, NC in late July.\r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI am a graduate of California State University, Northridge (1991), and the University of Washington (1993, 1995), all in mechanical engineering. I taught at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology from 2000–2020. My favorite courses were design, system dynamics, measurement systems, and data visualization. I retired from teaching in 2020.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nblog https://graphdr.github.io/data-stories/\r\nrepo https://github.com/graphdr\r\nmail graphdoctor@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nWelcome\r\nIn this workshop, we introduce a few basic ideas on creating effective charts of quantitative data.\r\nFor most of us, our education entailed years of training and practice using the tools of effective written and spoken communication, what we might term verbal rhetoric. Yet very few of us experience anywhere near as thorough a grounding in the tools of effective graphical communication, or visual rhetoric.\r\nThis helps explain why folks who may be perfectly competent otherwise can uncritically produce ghastly charts such as the “solar output profile” chart below.\r\nFigure 1: Example of an ineffective chart. Even if you take the time to understand what the chart purports to show, there is no compelling message for the audience to take away. Source: Clarke et al.
