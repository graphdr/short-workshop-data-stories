## Welcome

In this workshop, we introduce a few basic ideas on creating effective charts of quantitative data.  

For most of us, our education entailed years of training and practice using the tools of effective written and spoken communication, what we might term *verbal* rhetoric. Yet very few of us experience anywhere near as thorough a grounding in the tools of effective graphical communication, or *visual* rhetoric.  

This helps explain why folks who may be perfectly competent otherwise can uncritically produce ghastly charts such as the "solar output profile" chart below.

By the end of the workshop you should be able to 

- Describe limitations of common graph types
- Describe a graph type you had not encountered before 
- Explain how you might begin to think critically about visual information
